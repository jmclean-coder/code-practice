# Problem Solving Patterns

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast common problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems, and divide and conquer
  
Note: Theres pattern are NOT a cure all. I must understand each probelem as it's own challenge. These patterns are to helpo for when I recognize that they can be useful.

- Some patterns...
  - Frequency Counter
  - Multiple Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Backtracking
  - and more...

Programming blueprints or lego blocks
