/* Write a function called minSubArrayLen which accepts two parameters 
- an array of positive integers and a positive integer.

This function should return the MINIMAL LENGTH of a CONTIGUOUS SUBARRAY 
of which the SUM is >= the INTEGER PASSED TO THE FUNCTION. 
If there isn't one, return zero instead.

My Words: This function needs to target the smallest subarray of values that
when each value is added together, the sum is equal to the number that is passed in
if there is any single value greater than the number passed in, return 1
if no subarrays are found, return 0 <--- solve this first and the rest will come.
